# Pokémon Chatty Crystal

Welcome to TPP's latest anniversary ROM hack! This game features another comeback of the chatty mechanic, where part
of the game's text is taken from TPP's stream chat. There are likewise some special moves controlled by the chat as
well. Notwithstanding, the game is fully playable without access to a stream.

The game features 400 Pokémon across most generations, over 360 unique moves, and a number of bonus side quests that
augment the base game of Pokémon Crystal.

In order to build this ROM, you'll need version 0.5.0 of [RGBDS]. Also, in order to build the ROM patch, you'll need
ROMs for Pokémon Crystal 1.0 and 1.1 (drop them as `baserom.gbc` and `baserom11.gbc` in the project's root directory).

This hack is based on the [pokecrystal16] engine.
